/**
 * This interface describes data record format
 * similar to the European Data Format (EDF)
 * which is a standard for exchange and storage of multichannel biological
 * and physical signals.
 * <p>
 * Tha base idea is that all samples received from multiple
 * measuring channels (signals) within the specified time interval
 * are placed in one data record (or package) as follows:
 * <br>n_0 samples belonging to signal 0,
 * <br>n_1 samples belonging to signal 1,
 * <br>...
 * <br>n_k samples belonging to  signal k
 * <p>
 * Every signal may have its own sample frequency!
 * <br>The number of samples n_i = (sample frequency of the signal_i) * (time interval).
 * <p>
 * In our case data record/package is just an array of integers. Every measured
 * digital sample is saved as one integer. A linear relationship between
 * digital (integer) values stored in data record/package and the corresponding
 * physical values are assumed. To convert digital values to
 * the physical ones (and vice versa) <b>digital minimum and maximum</b>
 * and the corresponding <b> physical minimum and maximum</b>
 * must be specified for every signal.
 * These 4 extreme values specify offset and amplification of the signal:
 * <p>
 * (physValue - physMin) / (digValue - digMin)  = constant [Gain] = (physMax - physMin) / (digMax - digMin)
 * <p>
 * <br>digValue = (physValue / Gain) - Offset;
 * <br>physValue = (digValue + Offset) * Gain
 * <br>
 * Where scaling factors:
 * <br>Gain = (physMax - physMin) / (digMax - digMin)
 * <br>Offset = (physMax / Gain) - digMax;
 * <p>
 * In general "Gain" refers to multiplication of a signal
 * and "Offset"  refer to addition to a signal, i.e. out = (in + Offset) * Gain
 * <p>
 * Full specification of EDF:
